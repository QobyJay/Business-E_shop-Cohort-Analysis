📌 Overview
This project analyzes customer retention patterns using cohort analysis, a method that groups customers based on their acquisition period and tracks their behavior over time. The goal is to understand churn rates, retention drivers, and customer lifecycle value, providing actionable insights to improve loyalty strategies.
🎯 Objectives
Identify customer retention and churn trends across different cohorts.
Measure customer lifetime behavior by acquisition month.
Detect periods of high attrition to guide targeted interventions.
Provide data-driven recommendations to improve long-term retention.
